Form Tabs
================

There are often times when you need to put parts of a long form into tabs, this
will allow you to use a new form type called "tab" in order to accomplish this.

Here's an example form:

```php
public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
{
    $about = $builder->create('about', 'tab', array(
        'label' => 'About'
    ));

    $about
        ->add('first')
        ->add('last');

    $social = $builder->create('social', 'tab', array(
        'label' => 'Social'
    ));

    $social
        ->add('facebook')
        ->add('twitter');

    /**
     * Add both tabs to the main form
     */
    $builder
        ->add($about)
        ->add($social);
}

public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver)
{
    $resolver->setDefaults(array(
        'tabbed' => true,
        'tabs_class' => 'nav nav-pills nav-stacked',
    ));
}
```

You will need to make sure that you set the "tabbed" option to true on the form
that is the parent of the tabs - This lets the view know to render the tabs
alongside the form. You can also change the class that gets rendered on the tabs
ul by specifying the `tabs_class` option. If you do not want the whole thing to
be rendered at once, you can use the `form_tabs` function on the tabs' parent
form (the same form you set tabbed == true).

```jinja
<div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
        {{ form_tabs(form) }}
    </div>

    <div class="span8">
        {{ form_widget(form) }}
    </div>
</div>
```

*Be Aware:* If you use `form_widget` before `form_tabs` it will also render the
tabs, and you will not be able to render them again.

Finally, if you need full control over the tabs, you can access them like:

```jinja
{% for id, label in form.vars.tabs %}
   {# ... #}
{% endfor %}
```
